Task: Image Classification using CNN
Definition: Image classification involves extracting features from images to look for 
specific patterns in the dataset. Image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a deep learning  task that involves training a neural network to recognize images and 
classify them into classes or classes. CNNs have proven useful for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical features from image data.
Dataset: Weâ€™ve been provided with a dataset of vehicle logos and we have to identify the logo for a particular car model.
Platform used: Google Colab

Procedure:
Data Import and Preprocessing, Data Augmentation, Loading Training and Validation Data, Feature Engineering (if necessary), Labelling, Training and Validation Data, Model Building, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation, Plotting Metrics, Training the model, Model checkpointing and early stopping, Testing the model.
